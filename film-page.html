    					<h2>Fit to Print</h2>
    					<p>What happens when former newspaper reporters are no longer able to pursue important investigative stories?</p>
	            
	                	<!--<iframe src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/44007842?title=0&byline=0&portrait=0" width="460" height="260" frameborder="0"></iframe>-->

	            		<div id="film-description"><h3>Synopsis</h3>
							<p><a href="http://www.fittoprintfilm.com" target="_blank"><i>Fit To Print</i> </a>examines the on-going crisis within the U.S. newspaper industry and its impact on local investigative reporting. The film includes interviews from reporters, staff members, and media experts within several major U.S. newspapers, including The New York Times, The Washington Post, The Los Angeles Times, The Wall Street Journal, among others. </p>

							<p>Through interviews with former executives at the leading newspaper companies, we illustrate a change in business practices, beginning in the 1960s. Newspapers became less a public service than a business enterprise designed to please stockholders. Unfortunately, newspaper companies historically neglected investment in new technologies and expanded classified advertising online despite direct proposals from major internet search engine companies and advertising entrepreneurs. They missed their opportunity and have cut their staffs to compensate for the monetary losses.</p>

							<p>We give those laid off staffers a voice in this film. We interview reporters, editors and photographers who are only a few of the over 15,000 newspaper layoffs since 2008. They get a chance to tell the public their stories. In addition, we follow several laid off-investigative reporters as they gallantly attempt to publicize important watchdog stories. These stories are emblematic of the crisis that is currently facing the newspaper industry.</p>

							<p>The first investigator we follow is two-time Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Andrew Schneider. Schneider was laid off from the Seattle Post-Intelligencer, after uncovering an extensive corporate cover-up in the city of Libby, Montana. However, we reveal that there is more to this story but no reporter to tell it, including suspect activity within the EPA.</p>

							<p>Stephen Janis is an award-winning investigative reporter who lost his job at The Baltimore Examiner when it shut its doors in 2009. Janis won a Maryland-Delaware-DC Press Association award in 2008 for investigative reporting on the high rate of unsolved murders in Baltimore. Since his paper has shuttered, he has continued an on-going series regarding the arrest policy procedures by the Baltimore City Police Department and the affect this has on local communities.The Baltimore Police Department has been embroiled in controversy and lawsuits over faulty arrests and policing tactics that led to tens of thousands of people being detained without credible charges. Janis is now continuing his series by funding it on his own through a start-up investigative news website. Through interviews with Baltimore City Police officers, city officials and citizens of Baltimore city neighborhoods, Janis is attempting to keep this story alive. </p>

							<p>Laura Frank is a former investigative reporter with The Rocky Mountain News before it ceased publication in 2009. Here Frank began an on-going investigation detailing workers who were exposed to nuclear radiation at the Rocky Flats Nuclear Weapons Facility in Colorado. Frank discovered that more than 3,000 Rocky Flats workers have been exposed to lethal radiation. Over 175,000 workers have applied for employee occupational illness compensation benefits through the Government since 2000. Frank has uncovered that program officials have kept information secret, continually changed rules, and have "considered spying on some workers who filed claims". Frank and the victims she has spotlighted in the series hope the story will continue to gain media attention from other media outlets despite the Rocky Mountain news closing down. </p>

							<p>Despite layoffs, Stephen Janis, Andrew Schneider, and Laura Frank have continued to fight to tell stories on their own without the backing of a major news organization. Additional interviews with other start-up news organizations will be shown to further examine the changing role of non-profit news media. The viewer will learn that even in the world of non-profit news, a new business model is taking form, where innovative revenue streams must be maintained in order to survive. This concept has rarely been examined in a documentary, if at all, simply because it is so new to our current journalism culture. Many of those embarking on startups are fearful of having little or no money to pursue their goals. For anyone interested in the field of journalism today, this documentary will serve as a vital portrait of both the pitfalls and success stories in the new wave of journalism outlets.</p>

							<p><h3>Why are you telling this story?</h3> We are helping to shed light on how the newspaper industry might improve itself in the future by avoiding mistakes made in the past. We are also telling this story to shed light on a handful of important investigative stories which still need public attention as the only reporters once covering them have recently lost their newspaper jobs. These stories affect entire communities and sometimes mean the difference between potential life and death for the people covered.  </p>

							<p><h3>What stage is your film currently at?</h3> We are currently in post-production.</p>

							<p><h3>How do you plan to use the money?</h3> We plan to use the money help secure rights for stock footage and images, and to pay for our post-production facility and finishing costs.
							<h3>Who is your film&#39;s target audience</h3> Anyone involved in or interested in the practice of journalism. The entire public is affected by shifts in how news is reported.</p>

							<p><h3>About the Filmmakers</h3>
							<p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/adamgchadwick" target="blank">Adam Chadwick</a> attended film school at the University of Colorado-Boulder. He made his first short film in 2005 which ended up being screened at the New York International Independent Film &amp; Video Festival and was awarded the best writing and short film awards from the International Digital Video Awards. From 2006-2007 he worked for NFL Films as an assistant and later as a production coordinator. From 2007-2009 he moved to New York City and worked at The New York Times as a copy-editor. During his time with The New York Times, the idea for the film &quot;Fit to Print&quot; was born. </p>
							<p> <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/wherewolfe" target="blank">Nancy Wolfe</a>, the producer and editor of the film, was trained in film and journalism at The New School in New York. Her film credits include assisting with the production of &quot;LOVELESS&quot; 2011 with Streetlight Films.
